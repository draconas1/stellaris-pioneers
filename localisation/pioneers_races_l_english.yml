 START_SCREEN_PEA:0 "The Earth Empire is the remaining half of the Old Earth regime. \nIt is still governed from the ancestral homeworld of the human species, and as such those within the Empire consider themselves a truer, more noble form of human. Even those at the bottom of the heap within the Empire can still look down at the humans of the Federation, or worse, the Cooperative.\n\n Society is heavily stratified within the Empire. Resources, rights and freedoms are distributed unevenly, in a way that makes those who study history smile and mutter about a second Rebellion.\n However the Imperial Family have made changes since the Rebellion happened. Rather than limiting the opportunities of those below them to rise again, instead they have tried to ameliorate the motives that led to the Rebellion. As such there are now tangible benefits at every layer of their feudal system, even at the bottom."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_PFederation:0 "Federation"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_PFederation_desc:0 "Although the Federation is ostensibly governed by a centralised body, the majority of power and wealth is held by vast megacorporations.\n These business groups act almost entirely outside of governmental control, and hold such sway within government ranks that, to all intents and purpose, they are the governing body.\n\n Although to outsiders the Federation may appear a relaxed a liberal structure, the corporations who hold sway are often reactionary and totalitarian.\n However within the structures advancement is a definite opportunity, and one based on competence, rather than family. The genders are treated equally too, with no expectations of specific behaviour from either, other than total loyalty to the Federation."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_PCoop:0 "Cooperative"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_PCoop_desc:0 "The Second Revolution was an uprising from within the Federation aimed at preventing its slide into corporate fascism. It failed. The surviving rebels fled to a cluster of systems that had been surveyed but not occupied, or terraformed, to live free; free from oppression; free from rules; and free, sadly, from resources.\n\n Those who live on these frontier worlds have turned their backs on the power structures of the other two Human societies and live as pure Anarchists, utterly rejecting the notion of any but the loosest and most temporary of leadership in favour of a complex web of social obligation, mutual support, and competition for personal glory.\n\n A few groups within the Co-Operative form themselves into Workers Collectives, self managing their work and private lives as part of a survival effort."
