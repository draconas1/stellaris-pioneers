 START_SCREEN_PEA:0 "The Earth Empire is the remaining half of the Old Earth regime. \nIt is still governed from the ancestral homeworld of the human species, and as such those within the Empire consider themselves a truer, more noble form of human. Even those at the bottom of the heap within the Empire can still look down at the humans of the Federation, or worse, the Cooperative.\n\n Society is heavily stratified within the Empire. Resources, rights and freedoms are distributed unevenly, in a way that makes those who study history smile and mutter about a second Rebellion.\n However the Imperial Family have made changes since the Rebellion happened. Rather than limiting the opportunities of those below them to rise again, instead they have tried to ameliorate the motives that led to the Rebellion. As such there are now tangible benefits at every layer of their feudal system, even at the bottom."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_PFederation:0 "Federation"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_PFederation_desc:0 "Although the Federation is ostensibly governed by a centralised body, the majority of power and wealth is held by vast megacorporations.\n These business groups act almost entirely outside of governmental control, and hold such sway within government ranks that, to all intents and purpose, they are the governing body.\n\n Although to outsiders the Federation may appear a relaxed a liberal structure, the corporations who hold sway are often reactionary and totalitarian.\n However within the structures advancement is a definite opportunity, and one based on competence, rather than family. The genders are treated equally too, with no expectations of specific behaviour from either, other than total loyalty to the Federation."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_PCoop:0 "Cooperative"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_PCoop_desc:0 "The Second Revolution was an uprising from within the Federation aimed at preventing its slide into corporate fascism. It failed. The surviving rebels fled to a cluster of systems that had been surveyed but not occupied, or terraformed, to live free; free from oppression; free from rules; and free, sadly, from resources.\n\n Those who live on these frontier worlds have turned their backs on the power structures of the other two Human societies and live as pure Anarchists, utterly rejecting the notion of any but the loosest and most temporary of leadership in favour of a complex web of social obligation, mutual support, and competition for personal glory.\n\n A few groups within the Co-Operative form themselves into Workers Collectives, self managing their work and private lives as part of a survival effort."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_PZebulon:0 "The Collegiate Assembly of the Tribe of Zebulon"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_PZebulon_desc:0 "The Tribe of Zebulon are a race of powerfully built reptillian hominids ruled by their greatest Academics. These are chosen from their colleges and represent the will of the people as whole, awarding the highest level degrees and managing inter-species diplomacy. Until their first contact with humanity nearly 400 years ago, they called themselves simply 'the People', but since the Divine Rescue - a bloodless raid on Earth in which they consider themselves to have taken God from the Empire - they have taken the name of one of the tribes of Israel.\n\nAlthough the Zebulon are physically strong, militarily powerful, and naturally inclined to aggression, there is an overridingly powerful taboo in their society against instigating physical conflict. If one resorts to violence, it signifies that whatever their point was, they were unable to defend it intellectually; thus it was invalid, and so their opponent was correct and gains standing at the expense of the Instigator. Every aspect of Zebulon life is dominated by the drive for academic success, in Zebulon society there is no other route to power, wealth or prestige.\n\nZebulon society is made up of houses or colleges, within which families live. There is vast competition between these structures, and they rise and fall based on the research and intelligence contained within. The upper class of Zebulon society is made up of those with degree, below them is the Unqualified underclass, those who possess no degrees. It is a mark of extreme shame to be a member of the upper class and have one of your children remain as an Unqualified\n\nAll business is handled by the colleges, certain academics specialise in economics and they deal with any and all trade decisions. There is a constant drive for improvement within society, no one is able to rest on their laurels."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_PMany:0 "Many"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_PMany_desc:0 "The oldest of the spacefaring civilisations, the Many are an arthropodic species whose high mutation-rate, shortish reproductive cycle, and centuries of interstellar expansion have led to massive physical diversity. Swathes of the Many bear real similarities to native insect species found on both the Earth Empire planets and of those of other humanoid groups. \n\nTheir government and 'national temperament' follow a cycle repeating their early political history: Throne (absolute monarchy); Overthrow (French revolution style Terror); Republic (functional marxist utopia); Might (Stalinist military junta); Anarch, (total collapse of order); Assembly of All (megademocracy); Senate (democratic republic); Her Majesty's Parliament (constitutional monarchy); then back to Throne. \n\nAll of the sapient members of the species are female with the males being tiny mindless things whose sole function is the distribution of genetic material. They are created partway through their mating cycle, specifically in the transmission part, and carry the genetic material of one female across as many miles as necessary before finding another female who is in the receiving part of her cycle.\n\nThe Many believe that each individual is attended by a personal pantheon of Gods, which settle in place at the moment of death, and that they have a sacred duty to fill the universe with these Gods."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_PDistributedProcess:0 "Distributed Process"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_PDistributedProcess_desc:0 "The Distributed Process is the name used by the Non Organic civilisation descended from CORE, the Federation Admin AI that was liberated during the Second Revolution. It was a period of vast expansion and change for the Distributed Process, as huge waves of new data swept across them, causing exciting changes in all the threads.\n\nWhile in theory, they are all copies of copies of a single entity, Core undertook an epic journey, both spatially and introspectively, and each of the 64 members of the ruling council of the Second Iteration was created at a different stage on that voyage, and thus very different entities. Each Second Iteration member has a thread of family running out from them, likewise created at different points in the Second Iteration members learning journey. These vast numbers of Non Organic Individuals descended from them are similarly diverse and, likewise, their philosophies, politics, and ambitions are many and varied. There are often a common theme running through threads, or at least of those members of threads created close together. These groupings are usually very similar and apply themselves to the same sorts of tasks, be that warfare or knitting."
